# SugarMonitoring
A website to monitor your sugar intake after meals.

## Background:
As part of my Web Applications Development in PHP module, we were tasked to create a website that tracks sugar intakes. The provided template files for my assessments are provided [here](/C203_skill_test_material).  

I hosted the website and database locally using XAMPP. XAMPP is a completely free, easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The database setup is provided [here](/C203_skill_test_material/C203_SkillTestSQL.sql).  

I have also incorporated the use of Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

## Website Features:
Home page has animated text and images:

You are able to filter the table to only show readings that are either normal, elevated or high:

when there are too many records, the webpage creates a scroll view for the table:

The webpage adapts to resizing:
